## Configuration

This project requires an API key from The Movie Database (TMDB) to function correctly. You must create a `.env` file in the root of the project directory.

### `.env` File Setup

Create a file named `.env` in the project root and add the following key:

```
TMDB_API_KEY=your_tmdb_api_key_here
TMDB_API_KEY=94786bb06526502c891f050958db76e5 # This is a demo key for anyone to try```

-   **`TMDB_API_KEY`**: Used by the **backend** to get lists of popular and trending movies, as well as detailed movie information. This populates all the movie sections of the application. Get your key from [The Movie Database (TMDB) API](https://www.themoviedb.org/settings/api).

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Data Sources

- **TMDB (The Movie Database)**: Powers the trending movies, popular content, and TV show lists with official movie/show metadata, ratings, and images
- **Pirate Bay**: Provides the Top 100 torrent lists with real seeder/leecher data and magnet links
- **Multiple Torrent Sites**: LimeTorrents, KickAss, and Pirate Bay for comprehensive torrent search

### Components

1. **React Frontend** (`/src`): Modern single-page application with:
   - Live movie/TV browsing with auto-refresh
   - Top 100 torrent lists by category
   - Torrent search across multiple sites
   - Responsive dark theme UI

2. **Node.js Backend** (`/server`): Express API server handling:
   - TMDB API integration and data formatting
   - CORS configuration for frontend communication
   - Movie/TV show data with IMDB ID resolution

3. **Python Torrent Backend** (`/backend`): FastAPI server providing:
   - Multi-site torrent scraping (LimeTorrents, Pirate Bay, KickAss)
   - Top 100 lists from Pirate Bay
   - Torrent health data (seeders/leechers)

### Project Structure

---

## Setup and Installation (Windows)

This project includes a comprehensive setup script to prepare your entire development environment.

### Prerequisites

-   [Node.js and npm](https://nodejs.org/en/)
-   [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (version 3.7+ recommended, must be in your PATH)

### One-Time Setup

From the project root, run the `setup.bat` script. This will:

1.  Install all Node.js dependencies for both the frontend and backend.
2.  Create a Python virtual environment (`venv`).
3.  Install all required Python packages for the torrent API.

```sh
.\setup.bat
```

After the setup is complete, you are ready to run the application.

---

## Automated Startup (Windows)

For a convenient one-click start on Windows, you can use the `start.bat` script located in the project root.

```sh
.\start.bat
```

This script automates the entire startup process:
1.  **Cleans Up:** Stops any old processes to prevent port conflicts.
2.  **Checks Dependencies:** Ensures all server dependencies are installed.
3.  **Launches Servers:** Starts the Node.js backend, the Python torrent backend, and the React frontend concurrently.
4.  **Opens Browser:** Automatically opens the application in a new Chrome window.

This is the recommended way to run the application for development.

---

## üöÄ Deployment

### Netlify Deployment (Recommended)

This application is optimized for Netlify deployment with serverless functions:

1. **Connect to GitHub**: Link your Netlify account to this repository
2. **Environment Variables**: Set the following in Netlify dashboard:
   - `TMDB_API_KEY`: Your TMDB API key
3. **Build Settings**: 
   - Build command: `npm run build`
   - Publish directory: `dist`
   - Functions directory: `netlify/functions`
4. **Deploy**: Netlify will automatically deploy on every push to main branch

üåü **[Live Demo: woztorrentz.netlify.app](https://woztorrentz.netlify.app)** üåü

The production application includes Netlify Functions for:
- Movie/TV data from TMDB (`/api/movies/*`, `/api/tv/*`)
- IMDB MovieMeter integration (`/api/imdb/moviemeter`)
- Real-time torrent search across multiple sources
- Top 100 torrent lists by category

### Local Development Setup

#### Option 1: Automated Setup (Windows)

```sh
.\setup.bat    # One-time setup
.\start.bat    # Start all services
```

#### Option 2: Manual Setup

**Frontend Setup:**
```sh
npm install
npm run dev          # Starts Vite dev server on port 8080
```

**Node.js Backend Setup:**
```sh
cd server
npm install
npm start           # Starts Express server on port 3002
```

## üîß Development

### API Configuration

The application uses different API endpoints for different environments:

- **Production (Netlify)**: Uses Netlify Functions at `/api/*`
- **Local Development**: Uses local servers with proxy configuration

### Vite Proxy Configuration

For local development, Vite proxies API requests:
```javascript
// vite.config.ts
proxy: {
  '/api/v1': 'http://127.0.0.1:8011',     // Python torrent API
  '/api/movies': 'http://localhost:8888',  // Netlify functions (local)
  '/api/tv': 'http://localhost:8888',      // Netlify functions (local)
}
```

### Environment Variables

**Local Development (`.env`):**
```
TMDB_API_KEY=your_tmdb_api_key_here
```

**Production (Netlify Environment Variables):**
- Set `TMDB_API_KEY` in Netlify dashboard under Site Settings ‚Üí Environment Variables

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**TMDB API 500 Errors:**
- Ensure `TMDB_API_KEY` is properly set in environment variables
- For Netlify: Redeploy after setting environment variables
- Check if API key is valid at [TMDB Settings](https://www.themoviedb.org/settings/api)

**Torrent Search Not Working:**
- Ensure Python backend is running on port 8011
- Check if torrent sites are accessible (some may be blocked)
- Verify FastAPI server logs for errors

**IMDB Links Redirecting to TMDB:**
- This has been fixed in recent updates
- Clear browser cache and refresh
- Links now search IMDB when direct IMDB IDs aren't available

**Port Conflicts:**
- Frontend: Port 8080 (Vite)
- Node.js Backend: Port 3002 (Express)
- Python Backend: Port 8011 (FastAPI)
- Use `netstat -an | findstr "8080"` to check port usage

### Performance Optimization

- **Movie Data**: Now fetches 50 movies with optimized API calls
- **Timeout Handling**: 5-second timeouts prevent hanging requests
- **Error Recovery**: Robust fallback mechanisms for API failures
- **Caching**: Browser caching for movie posters and data
