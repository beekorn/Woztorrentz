## Configuration

This project requires an API key from The Movie Database (TMDB) to function correctly. You must create a `.env` file in the root of the project directory.

### `.env` File Setup

Create a file named `.env` in the project root and add the following key:

```
TMDB_API_KEY=your_tmdb_api_key_here
TMDB_API_KEY=94786bb06526502c891f050958db76e5 # This is a demo key for anyone to try```

-   **`TMDB_API_KEY`**: Used by the **backend** to get lists of popular and trending movies, as well as detailed movie information. This populates all the movie sections of the application. Get your key from [The Movie Database (TMDB) API](https://www.themoviedb.org/settings/api).

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Data Sources

- **TMDB (The Movie Database)**: Powers the trending movies, popular content, and TV show lists with official movie/show metadata, ratings, and images
- **Pirate Bay**: Provides the Top 100 torrent lists with real seeder/leecher data and magnet links
- **Multiple Torrent Sites**: LimeTorrents, KickAss, and Pirate Bay for comprehensive torrent search

### Components

1. **React Frontend** (`/src`): Modern single-page application with:
   - Live movie/TV browsing with auto-refresh
   - Top 100 torrent lists by category
   - Torrent search across multiple sites
   - Responsive dark theme UI

2. **Node.js Backend** (`/server`): Express API server handling:
   - TMDB API integration and data formatting
   - CORS configuration for frontend communication
   - Movie/TV show data with IMDB ID resolution

3. **Python Torrent Backend** (`/backend`): FastAPI server providing:
   - Multi-site torrent scraping (LimeTorrents, Pirate Bay, KickAss)
   - Top 100 lists from Pirate Bay
   - Torrent health data (seeders/leechers)

### Project Structure

---

## Setup and Installation (Windows)

This project includes a comprehensive setup script to prepare your entire development environment.

### Prerequisites

-   [Node.js and npm](https://nodejs.org/en/)
-   [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (version 3.7+ recommended, must be in your PATH)

### One-Time Setup

From the project root, run the `setup.bat` script. This will:

1.  Install all Node.js dependencies for both the frontend and backend.
2.  Create a Python virtual environment (`venv`).
3.  Install all required Python packages for the torrent API.

```sh
.\setup.bat
```

After the setup is complete, you are ready to run the application.

---

## Automated Startup (Windows)

For a convenient one-click start on Windows, you can use the `start.bat` script located in the project root.

```sh
.\start.bat
```

This script automates the entire startup process:
1.  **Cleans Up:** Stops any old processes to prevent port conflicts.
2.  **Checks Dependencies:** Ensures all server dependencies are installed.
3.  **Launches Servers:** Starts the Node.js backend, the Python torrent backend, and the React frontend concurrently.
4.  **Opens Browser:** Automatically opens the application in a new Chrome window.

This is the recommended way to run the application for development.
